    <p>
      A mixture of shrimp, pasta, and fresh vegetables make up this slightly
      spicy dish.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Pachage rigatoni pasta</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>1 can can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stems to Make The Dish</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is boiling cook the veggies so they will finish at the
        same time as the pasta. To do so, heat olive oil in a 12-inch (and deep)
        skillet over medium-high heat. Add red onion and carrot and saut√© 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour veggies into now empty pasta pot or a serving bowl, add drained
        pasta, drizzle in lemon juice, season with a little more salt as needed
        and toss while adding in pasta water to loosen as desired. Toss in 1/4
        cup parmigiano and parsley then serve with remaining parmesan on top.
      </li>
